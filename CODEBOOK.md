## Variables

The data set contains:
- a Subject variable between 1 and 30 that identifies the person
  taking part in the experiment.
- a LabelNames variable that describes the activity that classifies  
  the readings for each subject (e.g. Walking, Sitting, Standing...).
- variables describing the means and standard deviations of all
  measurements taken during the experiments.
